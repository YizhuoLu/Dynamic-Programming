# Dynamic-Programming

Here I collect some classical dynamic programming related problem and solve them in a correct way.

1. decodeWays: Given that 'A'-'Z' can be encoded by 1 - 26. Find the number of different ways that a given number can be 
decoded.
2. LongestAscendingSubarray: Find the length of the longest sub-array in the given array that are all in ascending order. 
3. MaxProductOfRope: Given a rope of integer-length n, find a way to get the max product of sub-ropes after m cuts.
4. JumpGame: Tell if you can jump to the last index in a jump game.
5. DictionaryProblem: Tell if the string can be composed by concatenating the words from the dictionary.
6. MinJump: Find the minimum steps that you need to jump to the last index.
7. LargestSubarraySum: Given an unsorted integer array, find the sub-array that has the greatest sum and return it.
8. EditDistancee: Given two strings of alphanumeric characters, determine the minimum number of replace, delete, and insert operation needed to transform one string into another.
9. LargestSquareOf1InMatrix: Find the length of the largest square of 1's in a given binary matrix.
10. LongestConsecutiveOnes: Find the length of the longest consecutive one's in a given array (only contains 0 or 1).
11. LargestCrossWithAll1s: find the largest cross with the same arm lengths and two arms join at the central point of each other in the given matrix.
12. LargestXInMatrix: Given a Matrix that contains only 0 and 1. Find and return arm length of the largest 'X' of '1's.
13. LargestSubsquare: Given a matrix where every element is either '0' or '1', find the largest sub-square surrounded by '1'.
