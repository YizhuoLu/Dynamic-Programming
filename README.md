# Dynamic-Programming

Here I collect some classical dynamic programming related problem and solve them in a correct way.

1. decodeWays: Given that 'A'-'Z' can be encoded by 1 - 26. Find the number of different ways that a given number can be 
decoded.
2. LongestAscendingSubarray: Find the length of the longest sub-array in the given array that are all in ascending order.
