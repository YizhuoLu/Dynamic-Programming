# Dynamic-Programming

Here I collect some classical dynamic programming related problem and solve them in a correct way.

1. decodeWays: Given that 'A'-'Z' can be encoded by 1 - 26. Find the number of different ways that a given number can be 
decoded.
2. LongestAscendingSubarray: Find the length of the longest sub-array in the given array that are all in ascending order. 
3. MaxProductOfRope: Given a rope of integer-length n, find a way to get the max product of sub-ropes after m cuts.
4. JumpGame: Tell if you can jump to the last index in a jump game.
5. DictionaryProblem: Tell if the string can be composed by concatenating the words from the dictionary.
